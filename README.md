### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
Most of my stuff on github is private, but if you are interested, you can contact me.
I enjoy programming in [Python](https://python.org), [JS](https://nodejs.org/), and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), doing web development in [HTML](https://www.w3.org/html/), [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), and [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), 3d modeling in [Blender](https://blender.org), and [rickrolling](https://kazmalhotra.github.io/rickroll.html) people. I am a student in Oregon. I am interested in formal and symbolic logic, computer science, squash, and biking. I enjoy co-teaching blender and an intro to linux at [FreeGeek](https://freegeek.org). I also developed some programming courses for a class my friends and I were teaching at school. See them [here](https://github.com/cgmsp). My pronouns are he, him, and his.
